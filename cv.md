### WORK EXPERIENCE

- *9/2022 - Present*. **Senior - AI Scientist** at the [Ireland's National Center for Applied AI](https://people.ucd.ie/sebastian.cajasordonez). As a core member of the AI team for [ICOS](https://www.icos-project.eu/), an AI ecosystem for Edge AI, I specialize in multi-modal learning, online learning, federated learning, and computer vision. Developing AI APIs, utilizing High Performance Computing (HPC), and implementing DevOps with Docker, Kubernetes and SLURM/Singularity. I support both national and EU innovation projects.

- *01/2022 - 01/2024*. **Fellow in Computer Science** at Harvard University. I developed and assessed Computer Vision and Deep Learning algorithms for imaging-based single-cell methods projects, specifically CyCIF using high-dimensional microscopy images, within Harvard's Visual Computing Group and the Harvard Medical School’s Lab of Systems Pharmacology. My work involved instance segmentation algorithms, unsupervised learning, image translation models, and unbiased pixel-level feature extraction for analyzing lateral spillover in segmented images of tissue. Supervised by Hanspeter Pfister and Siyu Huang at the *Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences*.

- *01/2022 - 08/2022*. **Machine Learning Intern** at [EcoVadis](https://ecovadis.com/). I developed an innovative attribution strategy leveraging Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) to enhance logo identification and verification within EcoVadis's production environment. This project combined YOLO and transformers for advanced text-image training and multi-modal logo identification. I also designed a self-supervised method for efficient logo annotation, curating over 20,000 images to refine the dataset, which significantly improved logo recognition in documents under the guidance of Sophia Katrenko in Paris, France.

- *05/2020 - 10/2020*. **Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence Engineer** at [AI India Innovation Centre](https://aiindia.ai/). I led the "Land Use Land Cover Classification using Advanced ML and DL Techniques for Larger Study Area" project. My primary tasks included accuracy assessment, satellite imagery dataset creation from scratch, model training and testing, as well as utilizing geospatial data and cloud services, including GPU and E2E cloud services, and Google Colab, based in Valencia, Spain.

- *2019*. **Astronomy and Physics Teacher**. My role involved educating 400+ students about astronomy and physics at Camp Poyntelle, Pennsylvania, U.S.A.

- *2016 - 2018*. **IT Network Technician**. Responsible for documenting all systems and network adjustments and ensuring the maintenance and installation of hardware and software for telecommunication and network devices across various faculties of the University of Cauca, Colombia.

- *2018*. **Computer Science Teacher**. Developed web and mobile applications as part of the general literacy curriculum program for refugees at Social Hackers Academy in Athens, Greece.

- *2018*. **Full-Stack Software Developer**. Designed and developed the official webpage for a psychiatric center in Athens, Greece, at Althaia Psychiatric Centre.

- *10/2013 - Present*. **General Director & CEO**. I serve as an astronomy interpreter and public speaker, overseeing financial resources and logistics at the Astronomical Observatory Francisco José de Caldas, Colombia.
