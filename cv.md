### Work experience

- *9/2022 - present*. **AI/Data Scientist II** at the [National Irish Center for Applied AI](https://people.ucd.ie/sebastian.cajasordonez). As a core member of the AI team for [ICOS](https://www.icos-project.eu/), an AI ecosystem for edge devices, I focus on multi-modal learning, online learning, federated learning, and computer vision. My role involves developing AI APIs, working with High Performance Computing (HPC), and applying DevOps practices such as Docker and SLURM/Singularity. My work supports both national and EU innovation projects, emphasizing data modeling and the enhancement of ML model deployment.
- *01/2022-01-2024*. **Fellow in Computer Science** at Harvard University. Develop/assess Computer Vision and Deep Learning algorithms on imaging-based single-cell methods projects on CyCIF using high-dimension microscopy images for the Harvard’s Visual Computing Group and Harvard Medical School’s Lab of Systems Pharmacology. Methods include instance segmentation algorithms, unsupervised learning, image translation models and unbiased pixel-level feature extraction over Lateral Spillover in Segmented Images of Tissue with Pixel-level Cell State. Supervised by Hanspeter Pfister and Siyu Huang. *Harvard john A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied sciences*.
- *01/2022-08/2022*: **Machine Learning intern** at Harvard University: I worked at Harvard's Hanspeter Pfister Lab improving instance segmentation and deep clustering models for cancer cell discovery using the FASRC Computing Cluster (HPC).

- *01/2022-08/2022*. **Machine learning intern** in [EcoVadis](https://ecovadis.com/). I developed an innovative attribution strategy using Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) to enhance logo identification and verification in a production environment within EcoVadis. This approach combined YOLO and transformers for advanced text-image training and multi-modal logo identification. I also designed a self-supervised method for efficient logo annotation and curated over 20,000 images to refine the dataset. I integrated these techniques to significantly improve logo recognition in documents under the guidance of Sophia Katrenko in Paris, France.
