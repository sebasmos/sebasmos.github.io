<p>As an AI scientist at the National Irish Center of Applied AI (CeADAR) and a Research Fellow at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), my research focuses on generative modelling and working with vasts amounts of data - cancer discovery, 3D neuron modelling and lately Machine Learning at the Edge. In EcoVadis (Paris) worked with contrastive image-text models and transformers, specifically in the context of industrial applications. Prior to that, I worked as a computer vision engineer in AI India, where I developed models for Land Cover Land Use using satellite imagery. I hold a B.S. degree in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering and have been awarded the EU Joint Master's degree in Image Processing and Computer Vision (2020-2022). I have actively contributed to several organizations and initiatives: served as the president of the Aerospace & Electronics Systems (AESS Colombia) in 2020, the NASA SpaceApps lead from 2020-2022-2033 and mentor in the MIT Critical Data dathathons 2022-2023. I like debugging & working with vast amounts of data.

Open to participate on research & competitions, challenges or research, feel free to drop me a message.
