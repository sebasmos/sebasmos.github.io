<p>
Full-stack AI scientist with 8 years of experience in Artificial Intelligence and 4 years as a professional AI engineer. I specialize in optimizing Visual Language Models (via distillation, pruning, quantization) and aligning Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). My work spans the full ML lifecycle - from front-end to scalable back-end systems - including training, fine-tuning, and evaluating LLMs like LLaMA and GPT-style models for both general and domain-specific tasks. I’m passionate about building interpretable, multimodal systems that integrate text, audio, images, and *un-structured data. I’ve led +35 funded projects and held leadership roles such as AESS President (2020), NASA SpaceApps Lead (2020–2025), and MIT Critical Data Mentor (2022–2025).
