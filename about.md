<p>
Dedicated Full-stack AI scientist with 8 yearsâ€™ experience in Artificial Intelligence, and 4 years of professional experience as a AI engineer. Specializing in generative modelling since 2022, I've advanced from intern to Research Fellow. Currently, I focus on Visual Language Models and AI alignment in security and ML, as well as the whole life-cycle of an ML-project, from front-end to the back-end. I've secured and led over 35+ successful grants. Leadership roles include AESS President (2020) - University of Cauca, NASA SpaceApps lead (2020-2024), and MIT Critical Data mentor (2022 - 2024).
